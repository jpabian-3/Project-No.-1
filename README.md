This includes files for Project No. 1
### Repo Structure
The repository includes the following files:
-[Raw Data](AirQuality_StudentVersion.csv)
-[Notebook](Project1.ipynb)
The data has been given via a CSV file that can be imported directly into the code.
The data was organized into the five locations in Nebraska with the highest concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5 and PM 10.0
A comprehensive list of days the maximum values and where the maximums occur
A statistical analysis on whether humidity and temperature impact air quality
Data was then  appropriately organized into Pivot Tables and printed in Python.
The statistical analysis of the temperature and humidity was printed separately from the other data.
